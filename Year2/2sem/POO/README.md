### Group - [JosÃ© Fonte](https://github.com/josefonte) | [DinÃ­s Estrada](https://github.com/DinisEstrada) Grade: 16.0

As part of the Object-Oriented Programming course, the project was developed in Java with the goal of managing and simulating a set of smart devices, houses with devices, and an energy market. The program had to fulfill:

- __Task 1__: construction phase. Build devices (SmartBulb, SmartCamera, SmartSpeaker), houses, and energy suppliers.
- __Task 2__: simulation phase where time advances and bills are issued.
- __Task 3__: statistics about the houses and suppliers.
- __Task 4__: change the state of devices (on/off) and modify the values of suppliers.
- __Task 5__: issue bills for each house.
- __Task 6__: create a terminal-based interface.

Important course requirements include implementing OOP principles such as __inheritance__, __abstract classes__, __polymorphism__, __data encapsulation__, and the __MVC approach__, as well as using __efficient data structures and algorithms__.
