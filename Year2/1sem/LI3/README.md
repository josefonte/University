# Computer Science Labs III

### Group - [Hugo Martins](https://github.com/hugomartins22) | [João Escudeiro](https://github.com/jbtescudeiro16) | [José Fonte](https://github.com/josefonte) Nota: 15

As part of the Computer Science Labs III course, the project was developed in C with the goal of analyzing large files (over 1 million records) and completing 3 scripts:

- Script 1 - Parsing the Files
- Script 2 - 10 queries (statistical and non-statistical), cross-referencing file data and data structures
- Script 3 - Interface and Testing

Two other important course requirements are the implementation of **data encapsulation** and **modularity**, as well as the use of **efficient data structures and algorithms** for **good memory management** since the files are very large (over 1 million records each).
