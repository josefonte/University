### Group 8 - [Jos√© Fonte](https://github.com/josefonte) | [Bernard Georges](https://github.com/) Grade: 16

As part of the Parallel Computing course, the group developed a project with the goal of optimizing a simple code to simulate the molecular dynamics of a given gas.

The group completed the following phases of work:

- **Phase 1**: Sequential Code Optimizations
- **Phase 2**: OpenMP Implementation (parallelization on CPU)
- **Phase 3**: CUDA Implementation (parallelization on GPU)
